 REANA example - "Pastabridge"
The ideer behind the building of a pasta bridge was to compare the forces that need to brake the bridge in real life and in theory. 
This bridge is constructed in the following way:
From above:

And from the side:

Ind the data file, I put 8 lines one that says Parameter, Experiment. And under it there is 6 values. The first one is the measured force it took to bake the bridge, in my case 16 N, next there is the angel in the corner but in radians, in the diagram it is called K. The next one is delta. It is the other angel also in radians. Then we have the weakest spot on the bridge, and what measured force it will take to break it, in N. the next one is the length that on the diagram is 8 but in m, it is 0.08. Then we have the number of pieces that are at the bottom of the bridge. So the number of times we have 0.08 meters. The last one is the hight of the bridge, in meters as well.
